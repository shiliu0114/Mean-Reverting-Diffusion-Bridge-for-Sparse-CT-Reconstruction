# Mean-Reverting-Diffusion-Bridge-for-Sparse-CT-Reconstruction
A PyTorch implementation of PMRDB  for sparse-view CT reconstruction. This framework utilizes an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to construct a diffusion bridge between the clean image distribution and a projection-based prior distribution, ensuring robust reconstruction without relying on pure Gaussian noise.
